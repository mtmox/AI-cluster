WORKING ON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I need to organize all reused variables so that all json file paths, database paths,
  and log file paths are stored in the contants.go file. This creates only one line I 
  have to change if i decide to change paths or redo directory structure.

- [Make general use function to write all output to log files, and then make collector
  which gets all log file output and sends it to a database. We need to keep track of 
  all output in realtime so I can see what the nodes are doing. Also create workflow
  dashboard so I can see the status of each mini in realtime. I want to know which 
  models are loaded, if they are processing a request, any errors, etc. I will need to
  make an error code lexicon and a comprehensive error code function, this will then
  get logged to log files. Every function within every file should have its own log 
  file. Make all code first, i will easily be able to go back and add the wrapper for 
  all error outputs.
- Im not sure how but i need to make a standard error function. If we get an error 
  we need to call this function and then handle the error by writing it to a data-
  base. Down the line we can actually specialize some AI's with our specific code-
  base and when we get an error we can pass it to the AI's and see how they would 
  resolve the issue. I could fork the repo and make an AI controlled repo, ill need
  to familiarize myself with docker cause youll want a standard env where the AI's
  can pass changes to so they can be tested. IDK this part will be more difficult
  but its a possibility later.]

URGENT NEEDS ATTENTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In my setup dir once the start and stop node .py files have started the subprocess
  we need to modify the start and stop .sh files so that they just start the go and 
  dont block. Right now the subprocess in the .py file is blocking because the .sh 
  file is waiting for the go program to complete. This is wrong. Non of it should 
  be blocking. Fix all .py and .sh files for start and stop in setup dir.
 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEEDS ATTENTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

- Unload all models if a mini goes down OR if the application closes.

- Do something with any leftover response message from the LLM in NATS subject out.chat.>

QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Need to create alphabetical and size ordered dropdown, be able to copy from outside clipboard
  into text box, create a kill all threads but selected button, fix having to double click on
  conversation when app starts, possibly redo layout of text box for a better look (move it to 
  the right of the button bar), make arrow keys work for paginating through output. Fix text input box so that I can paste into it and so that its larger, also make 
  shift + enter give me a new line.
